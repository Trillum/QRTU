In the Security section, explicitly set IP access to the key using CIDR notation, otherwise you can't use the API key. You can find the IP address of your local machine and add it to the Accepted IP Addresses section along with additional IP addresses for those that need access. If you don't have a fixed IP, or you are using the API key only in a local environment, you can just add **0.0.0.0/0** to the Accepted IP Addresses section to allow any IPs to use your API key.

(Optional): To add additional protection for your resources, set an explicit expiration date so your key automatically stops working after that date.

Click the Save and Generate key button.
